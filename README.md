# 🧮 GUI-Based Basic Calculator (OOP Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **GUI-based Basic Calculator** developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course.  
The calculator provides a simple and interactive interface to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

The project demonstrates the use of **OOP principles**, **event-driven programming**, and **GUI design** concepts.

## 🚀 Features
- User-friendly graphical interface.  
- Supports **basic arithmetic operations**:  
  ➕ Addition  
  ➖ Subtraction  
  ✖ Multiplication  
  ➗ Division  
- Handles invalid inputs with basic error handling.  
- Clear/Reset functionality.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Apply **OOP concepts** (classes, objects, encapsulation).  
- Gain hands-on experience with **GUI programming**.  
- Understand **event handling** in GUI applications.  
- Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking skills.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Java 
- **GUI Framework:** Swing / Tkinter  

---

## 📊 Future Improvements
- Add support for **scientific calculator features** (square root, power, trigonometric functions).  
- Improve UI with custom themes and styling.  
- Add keyboard input support.  
- Include history of calculations.
